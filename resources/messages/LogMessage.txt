In this view you can access any entries that you have made. You select what time period to view by clicking the (calendar) button.

From here you can also access the Graph by {rotating} the device counter clockwise.

The [Sort] button gives you different options for how to organise the entries and you can search among all entries regardless of time period by pressing [Search]. 

To see a detailed view of individual entries and their attachments, simply {click} on that entry. To delete an entry, {swipe} your finger across it and a [Delete] button will appear ({click} anywhere outside the [Delete] button if you change your mind).
