On this view you create and manage your tags. Tags are your own type of entries which you can, for example, attach to glucose readings and view in the graph. You have a "Create new tag" button in the top right corner and can edit any existing tags by pressing the cogwheel button next to them. To delete a tag, simply swipe your finger across it and a delete button will appear.
