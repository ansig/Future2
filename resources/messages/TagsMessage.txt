On this view you create and manage your tags. Tags are your own type of entries which you can, for example, attach to glucose readings or make stand-alone entries of in the Record view. 

You have a [Create new tag] button in the top right corner and can also edit existing tags by pressing the (cogwheel) button next to them. To delete a tag, simply {swipe} your finger across it and a [Delete] button will appear({click} anywhere outside the [Delete] button if you change your mind).
